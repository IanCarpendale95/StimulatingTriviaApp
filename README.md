StimulatingTriviaApp for Mobile App Development Module

#This repo is created so that there is a track record of my progress as I am working on my Mobile Application Development Project.
I have studied the labwork each week as we have been given them and trying to use that knowledge to create my own Mobile App using
the Development language which is Kotlin, I have not used this languague before only java to make mobile based applications where I used
Google vision API to create an app which uses this library to track landmarks around the world. I find Kotlin to be a lot easier to use and 
definilty enjoy it a lot more, what I have created is a Trivia App which is designed to be used for entertainment purposes, it asks a user their name
so they can address the user properly and then will go through each question I have created and show multiple answers, when an incorrect answer is selcted it will
show red and a correct answer is green, at the end it will tally up your result and give you feedback based on if you did well or not. 
I feel I have developed my learning and understanding of the Kotlin Language and will be utlizing what I have learned in my further learning of programming.
