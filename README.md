# StimulatingTriviaApp
StimulatingTriviaApp for Mobile App Development Module

This is version 1.1 of the Stimulating Trivia app I have created a main activity which has a text view of Stimulating Trivia, then
I have created a Cardview which holds a textview of Welcome followed by another text view which shows a message saying to enter your name to start trivia,
I have used the dependencie of the google.android.material package and have used this to create my text field where the user enters their name via a 
appcompat.widget, finally I have a button which simply says start. This is all for to improve on the UI for the user but in later versions of my
project the functionility will be improved.
